|workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... 
but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|
| Number of commits|
| Number of commits: by different people|
| Issues reports: there are **many**|
|  issues are being  closed|
| DOI badge: exists |
|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly |
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|
| Use of version control tools|

| Use of code coverage |
| other automated analysis tools|
| test cases exist||[test directory](https://github.com/shikhanair/TeachersPetBot/tree/main/test)|
| test cases are routinely executed||[GH Action](https://github.com/shikhanair/TeachersPetBot/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml)|
 | the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up||[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/shikhanair/TeachersPetBot/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)|
| issues are discussed before they are closed|
| Chat channel: exists|
| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|
| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|
|short release cycles |
